The log min and log max values change depending on the mie conversion table being used.
The log min and max values are the log of the amplitudes corresponding to 120 nm and 3000nm. The range is dependent on the ability of the POPS.

Scripps Pier:
1) logmin = 0.871
2) logmax = 4.067

Chestnut Ridge (Oakridge National lab
1) logmin = 1.576
2) logmax = 4.581


### The headers for the mie tables need to be consistent! d_nm and amp_scale
